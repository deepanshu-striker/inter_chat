# Real-time Audio Response Landing Page

This project is a landing page for a service that provides real-time audio recording and responses.

## Features

- **Headline:** Highlights lightning-speed real-time audio processing.
- **Authentication (Placeholder):** Includes Login/Sign Up buttons. Google Authentication is planned for future integration.
- **Pricing Tiers:**
    - Free: 50 responses
    - Pro: ₹499 for 300 responses
    - Business: ₹1599 for 2000 responses
- **User Dashboard (Mocked):** Displays mock data for responses used and remaining.
- **Subscription Management (Conceptual):** The page is structured to support subscription-based response quotas. Backend and payment integration are required to make this functional.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the landing page.
- `css/style.css`: Contains all the styles for the page.
- `js/script.js`: Includes basic JavaScript for mock interactions. This will be expanded for authentication, API calls, and dynamic content updates.

## Setup

1.  Clone the repository (if applicable) or download the files.
2.  Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the page.

## Future Development

-   Integrate Google Authentication for Login/Sign Up.
-   Develop a backend system to:
    -   Manage user accounts and authentication.
    -   Track subscription status and response quotas.
    -   Store user data securely.
-   Implement a payment gateway for handling subscriptions.
-   Connect the frontend to the backend via APIs to fetch user data and update response counts.
-   Build the core real-time audio processing functionality.
